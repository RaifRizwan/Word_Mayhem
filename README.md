# Word_Mayhem
Word Mayhem is a puzzle that shuffles the letters of a word. The program will randomly select a word from a list and will create a jumble or mixed up version of the word. The player of the game must guess what the original word was before it had been shuffled. Points are determined based off of how many tries the player needed to guess the word.
